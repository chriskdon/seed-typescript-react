#Typescript/React Seed Project

This is a seed project for getting a Typescript/React project with Browserify up and running quickly. It uses Stylus as the CSS preprocessor but that can be quickly changed out for LESS or SCSS.

## TODO
- [ ] Add `watchify` to speed up builds.
- [ ] Enable static file serving with a simple gulp server.
